<!--##
I'm a Ph.D. applicant applying for CS or ECE Ph.D. programs in 2021 Fall.
-->
Hi there! I'm a software engineer at Tencent(Tencent Cloud). My research interests lie in distributed systems, computer vision, and applied machine learning.
I obtained both my Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and Master's degree in Signal Processing from <a href="https://en.whu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Wuhan University</a> in 2012 and 2015 respectively. 
I have four years' working experiences as a software engineer. 

## News
* 02/03/2021: I joined Tencent(Tencent Cloud) as a backend developer, developing the API open platform of <a href="https://voovmeeting.com/" target="_blank">VooV Meeting</a>.
* 09/15/2020: I had been writing a <a href="https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2020/08/leetcode-experience-overview/" target="_blank">series of blog posts</a> summarizing various kinds of LeetCode algorithm questions. For those who have troubles 
understanding and solving LeetCode questions, you may find many useful tips and code templates in these blog posts.
* 07/16/2020: I passed the admission interview of <a href="https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/en/education/prospective-students/postgraduate-admissions-programmes/mphil-phd-programme" target="_blank">CUHK CSE Ph.D. program</a>.
* 04/15/2020: I was admitted into CS graduate programs of <a href="https://cs.ucdavis.edu/graduate" target="_blank">UCDavis</a> and <a href="https://www.cse.msu.edu/" target="_blank">MSU</a>.

## Research Projects
As a graduate student, my research areas included pattern recognition, computer vision and software engineering. I participated in a printer forensic project whose ultimate goal is to build a 
software system that can automatically identify printed documents, finding the source printer of a copy of docuemnt quickly and accurately. 

To build a robust and efficient document verification software, the biggest challenge is to eliminate the influence of different alphabetic characters’ local shape factor and preserve only texture factor.
Here are the two subprojects, corresponding to the two methods we adopt to eliminate shape factor. 

* By using texture synthesis algorithms: Printed Document Verification based on texture synthesis &nbsp;[[**paper**]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-015-2525-5)[[**code**]](https://github.com/xiaoluo-whu/nonparametric_search_texture_synthesis)
* By using the statistic model, two-factor analysis: Printed Document Verification based on two-factor analysis &nbsp;[[**paper**]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiao_Luo27/publication/282924491_Printed_characters'_texture_identification_based_on_two-factor_analysis/links/5dd037e692851c382f44052a/Printed-characters-texture-identification-based-on-two-factor-analysis.pdf)[[**code**]](https://github.com/xiaoluo-whu/printed_document_recognition)

## Industry Projects
I have several years' working experiences as a software engineer. Growing from a junior developer to a senior one, I have participated in
nearly every aspect of industrial software development, including backend, frontend, testing and DevOps. I have been trying to build large-scale scalable systems, improving consistency and availability.

* Backend server application of a financial management App with millions scale users &nbsp;[[**blog**]](https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2018/05/review-backend-structure/)
* Supply chain management system of an E-commerce company &nbsp;[[**code**]](https://github.com/xiaoluo-whu/SP)[[**blog**]](https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2019/08/review_server_prototype/)
* I once lead a seven members' team to develop a PDF search engine &nbsp;[[**blog**]](https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2017/11/pdf_parsing_searching/)

## Algorithms & LeetCode
I have been solving <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a> questions since 2014. In total, I have solved <a href="https://leetcode.com/LittileZiggs/" target="_blank">400+ questions</a>. 
I find it a very good way to grasp various data structure and algorithms, which would be very helpful in academia and industry projects.
However, without summarizing previous solved questions and periodically reviewing, it's very easy to forget.

Therefore, I have been writing a <a href="https://xiaoluo-whu.github.io/posts/2020/08/catalogue_leetcode_summary/" target="_blank">series of blog posts</a> to summarize various LeetCode's algorithm questions. By reading them, you may find 
many useful tips to crack LeetCode questions. I try to put similar and related quetions into one summary post and generalize a code template to 
solve them.

<!--## Recommenders
I have been fortunate to work with or under supervision of some very diligent and smart people in both academia and industry.
They will be my recommenders in my 2021 Fall application season. Should you have 
any questions or doubt about working with me, ask them.
